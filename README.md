## Warning

This is a third-party application and is not affiliated with Wuthering Waves or its developers. Because 
this app gets it's data from a local database located in the Wuthering Waves Game directory, it is possible that it could be flagged in some way by the game's anticheat. When testing, I did not encounter any issues, but I cannot guarantee that you will not be banned for using this application. Use at your own risk
